"""
A class method takes cls as the first parameter while a static method needs no specific parameters.
A class method can access or modify the class state while a static method canâ€™t access or modify it.
In general, static methods know nothing about the class state.
They are utility-type methods that take some parameters and work upon those parameters.
On the other hand class methods must have class as a parameter.
We use @classmethod decorator in python to create a class method,
and we use @staticmethod decorator to create a static method in python.
